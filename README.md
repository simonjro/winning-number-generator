# Winning Number Generator

An unpacked chrome extension to set the winning result in the Google 'random number generator' widget.

## About

This project was designed as a proof of concept to see if the widget can be compromised easily...it worked.

## Installation

1. Download the code as a zip file
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions
3. Click 'Load Unpacked'
4. Upload the downloaded zip file

## Usage

Go to the Google random number generator widget by searching 'random number generator' or https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator.

Click the extension icon and set the winning outcome.

Optionally you can set a skip value, this is how many times the plugin will run a pseudo random generator before landing on the fixed value.
